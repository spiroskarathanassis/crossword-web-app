Basic Rules

1. The pattern of black-and-white squares must be symmetrical. Generally this rule means that 
  if you turn the grid upside-down, the pattern will look the same as it does right-side-up.

2. Do not use too many black squares. In the old days of puzzles, black squares were not 
  allowed to occupy more than 16% of a grid. Nowadays there is no strict limit, in order 
  to allow maximum flexibility for the placement of theme entries. Still, "cheater" black 
  squares (ones that do not affect the number of words in the puzzle, but are added to make 
  constructing easier) should be kept to a minimum, and large clumps of black squares 
  anywhere in a grid are strongly discouraged.

3. Do not use unkeyed letters (letters that appear in only one word across or down). 
  In fairness to solvers, every letter has to appear in both an Across and a Down word.

4. Do not use two-letter words. The minimum word length is three letters.

5. The grid must have all-over interlock. In other words, the black squares may not cut 
  the grid into separate pieces. A solver, theoretically, should be able to proceed from 
  any section of the grid to any other without having to stop and start over.

6. Long theme entries must be symmetrically placed. If there is a major theme entry three 
  rows down from the top of the grid, for instance, then there must be another theme 
  entry in the same position three rows up from the bottom. Also, as a general rule, 
  no nontheme entry should be longer than any theme entry.

7. Do not repeat words in the grid.

8. Do not make up words and phrases. Every answer must have a reference or else be in 
  common use in everyday speech or writing.


Optional Rules
Do not repeatedly use words that are loose, joined together, or otherwise distorted (such as an reversed word).
